  - duplicates - .orange[how to identify?]

2. **Screening**: tens/hundreds of thousands records possibly to be excluded

  - exclusions - .orange[how much time/resources?]

3. **Analyses**: tens/hundreds numbers to extract (possibly from plots)

# How to save time?!


## .orange[Automation]...

- Question

  - find-replace / copy-paste search strings
  - regular expressions for translating search strings


- Screening

  - Records mangers for duplicates (MLT-based engine?!)
  - Negative search for records exclusions
  - find-replace text to merge/highlight keywords
  - use distinct colors for distinct keywords

# Machine Learning .orange[input]/.orange[output]



.left-code[
In machine learning, we provide the .orange[input] (data), the desired result, and what comes out is the .orange[learning] algorithm .

<br>
<br>

Mathematically, Machine Learning problems are simply .orange[*optimization*] problems

# Types of .orange[learning]

#### .orange[Unsupervised] learning

> The input data is _not labeled_ (there are not right answers!)

Data is given to the model, which is left to learn optimal .orange[patterns]/.orange[clusters].



#### (Passive) .orange[Supervised] learning

> The learning algorithm is provided with a set of inputs along with the corresponding .orange[correct] outputs.

The algorithm compares its current inferred output with the correct one to learn from its .orange[errors] (i.e., to minimize it).


#### .orange[Active] learning

> The learning algorithm .orange[interactively] queries a user (the _oracle_) to label new data with the desired (correct) outputs.

With input data labeled on the fly by .orange[oracle's knowledge], the model cycles query/train stages on the left unlabeled data.

# Learning's .orange[Neurons]

I.e., anything more than old new-fashioned (generalized*) logistic regressions

<br>

.center[<img src="img/neuron.gif" width="70%"/>]

<br>

$\text{output(s)} = g(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i*w_i)$

<br>

\*generalized := any **non-linear**, **differentiable**, $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ activation function.

# ML: .orange[optimized] neurons' network 

.pull-left[
<img src="img/fc.png" width="80%"/>

Each $W$ is one base dimension $\longrightarrow$<br>
The error is the height $\longrightarrow$

Every combination of possible Ws has its own error, i.e., an height

Finding better Ws by running down the (smooth) hills, we improve the model's performance! (.orange[It learns!])

]


.pull-right[

Select some (initially random) weights $W$, do the math, obtain a results.

Compare it with the true result, and obtain the error, i.e., a number.

(If the non-linearity $g$ satisfy good mathematical requirements...)

# Scoping search

### Questions
- Can we avoid explicit redundancy in the search string?
- Can we use preliminary results to iteratively create a search string?

### ML assistence
- Words variation/synonyms (supervised, one-to-one/one-to-many)
- MeSH extraction (supervised, many-to-many, human checked required)
- Clustering / topic modelling (unsupervised)

---

# Searching

### Question
- How can we make our search string suitable for multiple databases?


### ML assistence
- Machine translations (supervised, many-to-many)
  - E.g., PolyGlot - https://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot
- Pre-trained classifiers on records from standard databases search applied to other databases (supervised, many-to-one)
  - E.g., COSTUMER - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.06.015


---
# Screening

### Questions

- How can we filter out records that are not RCTs?
- How can we filter out records I am not interested in?

### ML assistence

- Classify relevant/not relevant (many-to-one)
  - Passive Pre-trained
     - E.g., RoboSearch - https://robotsearch.vortext.systems/
  - Active ranking 
     - E.g., ASReview - https://asreview.nl/

<br>

.orange[Trade-off]: minimize number of papers retained (exploration) Vs Maximize performance (exploitation). It is not possible to find a way to guarantee optimal performance without exploring all the records!

# SRs on .orange[Clinical Trials]

Clinical trial registries are under-utilized:

- No hierarchical branching structure
- Text search is based on few fields
- Cannot use queries’ combination
.right[Jones et al 2014, https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-4053-3-126]


<br>

.orange[Baudart et al] 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j448) reanalyzed 14 Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses, searching not only through standard databases but also in clinical trial registries:

- Increase of patients .orange[from 10% to 50%]
- Change in statistics .orange[up to 29%]

# Methodology

**Stage**: .orange[Searching] (Warning: not screening!)

**Learning**: .orange[Passive Supervised]

**Task**: Classification (.orange[many-to-one])


<br>
<br>

**Training set**:
- PubMed (294 positives and 7,200 negative records overall)

**Test**:
- ClinicalTrials.gov (233,609 records)

---
#### **Flowchart**

<img src="img/costumer.jpg" width="100%">

# Results

<br>

**left out 1 of 133 human-detected** positive citations .orange[from 233,609 trials] in ClinicalTrials.gov

<br>
<br>

The ability to distinguish on-topic from off-topic articles ranged from an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve .orange[(AUC-ROC) of 93.4% to 99.9%].

# .orange[Vienna Principles] (shortened)

.orange[International Collaboration for the Automation of System Reviews] (ICASR) 2015/10/02, Vienna Austria - https://ebrnetwork.org/the-vienna-principles/

- SRs involve multiple tasks: **all must be improved**.

- **Automation may assist with all tasks**.

- The processes for each task **can and should be continuously improved**.

- Automation must **facilitate** the production of SRs w/ **high standards**.

- Developments should also provide for **flexibility in combining and using**.

- To improve reviews as a whole will require **collaboration** between groups.

- Every automation technique **should be shared for free**.

- All automation techniques and tools should be evaluated using a **recommended and replicable method** with results and data reported.
